Feature: Product Management

  Scenario: Update an existing product
    Given I have an existing product with ID "123"
    When I update the product with new name "Updated Product Name" and price "199.99"
    Then the product's name should be "Updated Product Name"
    And the product's price should be "199.99"
    And I should see a confirmation message "Product updated successfully"
