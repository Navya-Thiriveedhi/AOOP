Feature: Product Search by Availability
  As a user
  I want to search for products based on their availability
  So that I can view only the products that are in stock

  Scenario: Searching a product by availability
    Given the following products exist:
      | Product Name     | Availability  | Price  |
      | Test Product 1   | In Stock      | $100   |
      | Test Product 2   | Out of Stock  | $50    |
      | Test Product 3   | In Stock      | $150   |
    When I search for products that are "In Stock"
    Then I should see "Test Product 1" in the search results
    And I should see "Test Product 3" in the search results
    And I should not see "Test Product 2" in the search results
