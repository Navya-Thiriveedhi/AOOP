Feature: Product Search by Category
  As a user
  I want to search for products by category
  So that I can find products within a specific category

  Scenario: Searching a product by category
    Given the following products exist:
      | Product Name     | Category     | Price  |
      | Test Product 1   | Electronics  | $100  |
      | Test Product 2   | Clothing     | $50   |
      | Test Product 3   | Electronics  | $150  |
    When I search for products in the "Electronics" category
    Then I should see "Test Product 1" in the search results
    And I should see "Test Product 3" in the search results
    And I should not see "Test Product 2" in the search results
