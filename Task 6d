Feature: Product Management
  As a user
  I want to view all products
  So that I can see the available products in the system

  Scenario: Listing all products
    Given the following products exist:
      | Product Name     | Price  |
      | Test Product 1   | $10.00 |
      | Test Product 2   | $15.00 |
    When I view the list of products
    Then I should see "Test Product 1" in the product list
    And I should see "Test Product 2" in the product list
