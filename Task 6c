Feature: Product Management
  As a user
  I want to be able to delete a product
  So that I can manage the product list effectively

  Scenario: Deleting a product
    Given a product "Test Product" exists in the system
    When I delete the product "Test Product"
    Then the product "Test Product" should no longer be in the product list
